# Telemarketing Campaign Prediction

This project tackles a very wide spread problem of predicting behaviour based on certain pattern and history of similar behaviour. In this particular case, the project aims to solve the problem of predicting customer behaviour based on a bank survey. The prediction is to identify if the customer will buy a particular loan or not.

This problem is particularly interesting to me because I was trying do a similar R&D project for my company in which we were trying to predict if a email was malicious or not based on the Meta data of the email. I know on the surface both implementation seem very different but in both cases we would be making binary classification based on some pattern of behaviour. This is the reason I choose this project.
